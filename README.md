## Answers to some problems from URI Online Judge

### To test the code just copy it to a folder then navigate to it using the terminal (Linux) and type:

```
$ g++ number_of_the_problem.cpp -o name_of_the_problem
```
```
$ ./name_of_the_problem
```


*ps: the ones with a _ after the name of the code are wrong or incomplete, the rest is OK.
